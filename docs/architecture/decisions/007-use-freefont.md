# 7 User FreeFont

## Context
The font used in the app is an important presentation aspect of the app
itself.
Considering the proper font is also part of the philosophy of the
project.

## Decision
Considering the idea of having this app inside F-Droid as first
publishing repository, I have decided to use
[GNU FreeFont](https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/index.html) and,
specifically, Free Sans as main and only font for the app.

## Status
Accepted.

## Consequences
There might be more future choices, depending on the need for foreign
languages.
