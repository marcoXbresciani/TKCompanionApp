## Known Security Issues

* **fast-xml-parser vulnerable to Regex Injection via Doctype Entities**

  * High
  * **Impact**

    "fast-xml-parser" allows special characters in entity names, which
    are not escaped or sanitized.
    Since the entity name is used for creating a regex for searching and
    replacing entities in the XML body, an attacker can abuse it for DoS
    attacks.
    By crafting an entity name that results in an intentionally bad
    performing regex and utilizing it in the entity replacement step of
    the parser, this can cause the parser to stall for an indefinite
    amount of time.

  * **Patches**

    The problem has been resolved in v4.2.4

  * **Workarounds**

    Avoid using DOCTYPE parsing by `processEntities: false` option.

  * **References**
