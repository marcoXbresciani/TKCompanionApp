# Architecture
The app is using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) framework to
possibly be portable on more platforms.
Specifically, Android and iOS.

The actual code is written in
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and it's fully available
in the `app` folder.
The `assets` and `i18n` folders have additional resources needed for the
project.

Not much of an "architecture":
* `globals` folder contains components that
  are generally used in all pages, or in at least a couple of them.
* `utils` folder is the same as usual: those are not React components
  but functions and things that are generally used.
* in the `pages` folder there are the actual pages, using subfolders if
  a page contains more than one main component.
