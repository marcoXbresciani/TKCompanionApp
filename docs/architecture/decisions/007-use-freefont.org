* ACCEPTED 7 Use FreeFont

** Context

The font used in the app is an important presentation aspect of the app
itself.
Considering the proper font is also part of the philosophy of the
project.

** Decision

Considering the idea of having this app inside F-Droid as first
publishing repository, I have decided to use
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/index.html][GNU FreeFont]] and,
specifically, Free Sans as main and only font for the app.

** Status

Accepted.

** Consequences

There might be more future choices, depending on the need for foreign
languages.
