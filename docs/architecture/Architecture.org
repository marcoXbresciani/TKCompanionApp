* Architecture

The app is using [[https://reactnative.dev/][React Native]] framework to
possibly be portable on more platforms.
Specifically, Android and iOS.

The actual code is written in
[[https://www.typescriptlang.org/][TypeScript]], and it's fully
available in the =app= folder.
The =assets= and =i18n= folders have additional resources needed for the
project.

Not much of an "architecture", here: inside the =app= folder there's
everything related to code and pages of the app itself.
Specifically:

- =assets= folder contains static things like fonts.
- =components= folder contains components that are generally used in all
  pages, or in at least a couple of them.
- =config= folder contains configuration items and options.
- =i18n= contains the translations.
- in the =pages= folder there are the actual pages, using sub-folders if
  a page contains more than one main component.
- =utils= folder is the same as usual: those are not React components
  but functions and things that are generally used.
