** Context

The bottom navigation bar cannot contain all the possible icons and
elements that might be needed for this app.

** Decision

The whole set of readable documents, including 5Q card and the four
steps of improvement are all moved inside the Docs menu.

** Status

Accepted.

** Consequences

User might need to click twice to see the reference 5Q card, first on
the "Docs" menu icon in the bottom navigation bar, and then on the 5Q
card icon itself in the Documents page.
