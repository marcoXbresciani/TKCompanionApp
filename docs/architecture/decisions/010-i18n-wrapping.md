# 10 I18N Wrapping

## Context
Considering that the app natively supports multiple languages, there is
the need so somehow isolate this responsibility in its own area, to
mixing it up with other things.

## Decision
The `app\i18n\i18n.ts` will collect all the needs for the I18N concerns
and exposes the correct `i18next` function for all other modules.

## Status
Accepted.

## Consequences
All modules, functions and components in need for the I18N, must import
`i18next` from the local `app\i18n\i18n.ts` file instead of importing it
from the reference library.
