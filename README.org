A short and small helper for Toyota Kata practitioners

Goal of this app is to be a practical vademecum/handbook for those
interested in applying scientific thinking through Toyota Kata.
It contains the Coaching Kata 5Q card, plus (possibly) more things
and information.
Content to be improved and updated from time to time.

*Alert*:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Please note that TKCompanionApp is currently *not* on Google Play and
won't be there in the near future.

There already was a case of an unwanted, ads-filled clone/copycat of
TKCompanionApp on Google Play.

If you have downloaded TKCompanionApp from Google Play or Apple Play
Store please, for your safety, remove it and install it only from
F-Droid or from APK files available on the Codeberg repository.
#+END_QUOTE

See file [[/docs/SECURITY.org][SECURITY.org]] for notes and updates
related to security issues.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: background
:END:

From [[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mrother/Homepage.html][the Toyota Kata website]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Toyota Kata is a way for managers and educators to initiate and coach
practice of practical scientific-thinking skills in their teams, to
develop and mobilize creative capability.
Competitive conditions favor teams and organizations that know how to
adapt.
It's not as difficult as you might think, because you can begin by
practicing a set of simple "Starter Kata."

Toyota Kata is about starter practice routines for developing scientific
thinking.
From there each individual & team can develop their own way.

Toyota Kata is a skill-building process that shifts you and your team
from a natural tendency to jump to conclusions ... to thinking, working
and reacting more scientifically.
Best of all, you only need to practice 20 minutes a day, under the
guidance of your coach.
#+END_QUOTE

* Install
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: install
:END:

This app is currently built using React Native to make building the app
for both Android and iOS from the same source code easier.

Unfortunately, publishing the app on Google Play Store or on Apple App
Store, requires money I don't want to spend: it's
[[https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6112435?hl=en&ref_topic=3450769#zippy=%2Cstep-pay-registration-fee][one-time $25]]
for a Google Developer Account, and it's even
[[https://developer.apple.com/support/enrollment/][$99/year]] (!) for
the Apple Developer Program.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If you found it, *DO NOT* download TKCompanionApp from Google Play or
Apple App Store: it's not the real one available from F-Droid or
Codeberg!
#+END_QUOTE

So (for now) you can find this app /only/ through the
[[https://f-droid.org/][F-Droid]] /installable catalogue of FOSS (Free
and Open Source Software) applications for the Android platform/.

[[https://f-droid.org/packages/name.bresciani.marco.tkcompanionapp][https://fdroid.gitlab.io/artwork/badge/get-it-on.png]]

To install this app, you then need the F-Droid client app (pretty
similar to Google Play Store or Apple App Store) from the
[[https://www.f-droid.org/][main site]]: there's an easy QR Code to
download and
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Droid#Client_application][install it]].

Then, open the F-Droid repository app and search for
[[https://f-droid.org/en/packages/name.bresciani.marco.tkcompanionapp/][TKCompanionApp]].
Install it, and open it.

Eventually, you can directly download the APK from the
[[https://f-droid.org/en/packages/name.bresciani.marco.tkcompanionapp/][app page on F-Droid website]],
to be installed manually on your device.
There's no difference in functionalities, the only difference being the
fact that without the F-Droid client app you won't receive automatic
updates (just like Google Play did with other apps).

Welcome to the world of FOSS.
Please also take a look at all other wonderful FOSS apps you can find in
F-Droid.

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: usage
:END:

Well, it's easy: install the app, open the app, click some buttons.
There are no games, no quizzes, no actions to take (yet).
Just sit, follow the menu, learn, practice and improve.

The app is divided into four main areas.

#+TOC: headlines 1 local

** Home
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: home
:END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 300px
[[file:fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/home.png]]

The Home page currently shows the 5Q card and also gives the possibility
to:

- change language through the /Settings/ menu (top left),
- see the Legend panel with the explanations of all the buttons
  functionalities, for each page
- see the /Contact/ panel with a brief statement on the privacy side and
  the contact channels
- see the /Copyright/ panel, with the GNU General Public License
  copyright notice, the translator(s) names for the selected language
  and the font coyright notice.
- see the /About/ panel with the current version number, the privacy
  statements with some useful links and the source code repository
  references.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 300px
[[file:fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/about.png]]

** PDSA Journal
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pdsa-journal
:END:

The PDSA Journal page allows you to daily write your answers to the 5Q
card, with a reference calendar and navigation buttons.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 300px
[[file:fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/pdsa.png]]

You are free to save and delete a full whole day or each single answer
alone.
You can also navigate directly to today (current, default day when
opening the page) or browse the calendar.

** Documents
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: documents
:END:

The Documents page shows some reference documents and note from the
Toyota Kata community.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 300px
[[file:fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/docs.png]]

Together with the 5Q card there is the Kata Code and a few other things
that you can read directly from the app or see their original source by
opening the associated reference link.

** Events
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: events
:END:

This is a manually-updated list of known (by me!) events, world-wide,
related to Toyota Kata.

Main source is currently
[[https://twitter.com/RealMikeRother][Mike Rother's Twitter account]]
but feel free to suggest more events.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Note: since the app has no Internet connection, I have to manually
update its content every time an event is expired or has to be added.
It might be not realtime, but I prefer to preserve privacy instead of
letting the app connect to the Internet, as far as I can.
#+END_QUOTE

Events are listed in start dates order, with their official title as
shown by the reference website, also added for navigation purposes (from
your phone browser).
