# ADR 000: Documenting Architecture Decisions

## Context
As developers, we want to record architectural decisions made in this
project for future references.

Which format and structure should these records follow?

## Decision
Let's use the original ADR format described in [Michael Nygard's
template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Status
Accepted.

## Consequences
* The project shall keep tract of all decision, as described in the
  reference [Documenting Architecture
  Decisions](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
  document.
* The index shall be kept updated.
* The [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) file should keep track of the
  added ADRs for each update/release.
* Future developers can have a quite comfortable and useful guide on how
  to navigate through the architectural structure of the application.
