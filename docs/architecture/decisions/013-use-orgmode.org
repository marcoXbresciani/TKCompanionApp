* ACCEPTED 13 Use Org Mode

** Context

As developers, we want to record architectural decisions made in this
project for future references.

** Decision

Let's use the original ADR format described in
[[http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions][Michael Nygard's template]],
but using Org Mode instead of Markdown format.

Markdown has too many flavours (8, at least) that are generally not
fully compatible each other.
Org Mode is unique, robust, well structured and supported.

** Status

Accepted.

** Consequences

- The project shall keep tract of all decision, as described in the
   reference
   [[http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions][Documenting Architecture Decisions]]
   document, but in Org Markup.
- The [[file:../../../CHANGELOG.org][CHANGELOG.org]] file should keep track of the added ADRs for each
  update/release.
- Future developers can have a quite comfortable and useful guide on how
  to navigate through the architectural structure of the application.
- Developers shall know their
  [[https://orgmode.org/org.html#Markup-for-Rich-Contents][Org Mode Markup for Rich Contents]]
  that is not much different from Markdown, AsciiDoc or other
  lightweight markup languages.
- Emacs export to HTML (=C-c C-e h o=) can be used to "verify" the
  proper use of the Org markup for rich text formatting,
