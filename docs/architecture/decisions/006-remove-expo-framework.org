* ACCEPTED 6 Remove Expo Framework

** Context

Expo Framework, for React Native, allows a seamless usage of Android and
iOS platforms, with a common configuration and automagic things.
Though, as all frameworks, poses some constraints.

** Decision

Considering the constraints and the impossibility to release the app
through F-Droid, I have decided to not use Expo Framework and keep only
the pure React Native part.

** Status

Accepted.

** Consequences

There will be some more struggle to cope with Android- and iOS-specific
amenities, but still removing Expo Framework allows for fine-grained
control.
