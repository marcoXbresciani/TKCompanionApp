# Architecture
The app is using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) framework to
possibly be portable on more platforms.
Specifically, Android and iOS.

The actual code is written in
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and its fully available in
the `app` folder.
The `assets` and `i18n` folders have additional resources needed for the
project.
