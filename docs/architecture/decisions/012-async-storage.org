#+TITLE: TKCompanionApp - 12 Async Storage

* ACCEPTED 12 Async Storage

 Deprecates [[file:009-encrypted-storage.org][9 Encrypted Storage]].

** Context

Giving the possibility to change settings of the application, it is
better for the user to be able to keep those settings valid through all
the uses of the application, even if the application is frozen or
terminated.

** Decision

Since the app is not password-protected, using an encrypted storage is
basically useless.
For this reason, this decision reverts and cancels decision number
[[file:009-encrypted-storage.org][9 Encrypted Storage]] while introduce
the more plain
[[https://reactnative.dev/docs/asyncstorage][React Native Async Storage]].
There is currently no need to use files for this purpose.

** Status

Accepted.

** Consequences

If users ask for more safety, there'll be the need to password-protect
the application.
