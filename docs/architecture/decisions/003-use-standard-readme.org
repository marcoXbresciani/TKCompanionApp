* DEPRECATED 3 Use Standard ReadMe

See [[file:014-use-org-readme.org][14 Use Org Readme]]

** Context

*What is a readme?*
A readme is a file which is normally the first entry point to your code.
It should tell people why they should use your module, how they can
install it, and how they can use it.
Standardizing how you write your README makes creating and maintaining
your READMEs easier.
Great documentation takes work!

*Why keep a readme?*
Your documentation is complete when someone can use your module without
ever having to look at its code.
This is very important.
This makes it possible for you to separate your module's documented
interface from its internal implementation (guts).
This is good because it means that you are free to change the module's
internals as long as the interface remains the same.
Remember: the documentation, not the code, defines what a module does.

*Who needs a readme?*
People do. Whether consumers or developers, the end users of software
are human beings who care about what's in the software and how to use
it.

** Decision

The project will use and keep a =README.md= file, in Markdown format,
following the guidelines and rules of
[[https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme][Standard Readme]].

** Status

+Accepted.+
Deprecated on 2023-08-14.

** Consequences

The =README.md= file shall be taken care of and kept updated.
