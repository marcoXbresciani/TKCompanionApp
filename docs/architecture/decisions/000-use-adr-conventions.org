** Context

As developers, we want to record architectural decisions made in this
project for future references.

Which format and structure should these records follow?

** Decision

Let's use the original ADR format described in
[[http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions][Michael Nygard's template]].

** Status

+Accepted.+
Deprecated on 2023-08-14.

** Consequences

- The project shall keep tract of all decision, as described in the
   reference
   [[http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions][Documenting Architecture Decisions]]
   document.
- The =CHANGELOG.md= file should keep track of the added ADRs for each
  update/release.
- Future developers can have a quite comfortable and useful guide on how
  to navigate through the architectural structure of the application.
