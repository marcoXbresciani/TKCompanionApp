# 1 Commit Message Rules

## Context

Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful.
We can't avoid it completely, so our efforts should go to
[reducing it](https://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m) [as much] as
possible.
Commit messages can do exactly that and as a result, a commit message
shows whether a developer is a good collaborator.

## Decision

Fortunately, there are well-established conventions as to what makes an
idiomatic commit message.
Indeed, many of them are assumed in the way certain commands function.
There's nothing you need to re-invent.
Just follow the
[seven rules](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules)
below and you're on your way to committing like a pro.

### The Seven Rules of a Great Commit Message

[before](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/30bce7/CONTRIBUTING.md#format-commit-messages).

1. [Separate subject from body with a blank line](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#separate)
2. [Limit the subject line to 50 characters](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#limit-50)
3. [Capitalize the subject line](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#capitalize)
4. [Do not end the subject line with a period](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#end)
5. [Use the imperative mood in the subject line](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative)
6. [Wrap the body at 72 characters](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#wrap-72)
7. [Use the body to explain what and why vs. how](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#why-not-how)

## Status

Accepted.

## Consequences

A properly formed commit subject line should always be able to complete
the following sentence:

If applied, this commit will `your subject line here`.

A project's long-term success rests (among other things) on its
maintainability, and a maintainer has few tools more powerful than his
project's log.
It's worth taking the time to learn how to care for one properly.
What may be a hassle at first soon becomes habit, and eventually a
source of pride and productivity for all involved.
